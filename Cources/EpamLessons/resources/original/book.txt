    Resource bundles belong to families whose members share a common base name, but whose names also have additional
components that identify their locales. For example, the base name of a family of resource bundles might be "MyResources".
The family should have a default resource bundle which simply has the same name as its family - "MyResources" - and will
be used as the bundle of         last resort if a specific locale is not supported. The family can then provide as many
locale-specific members as needed, for example a German one named "MyResources_de".

    Each resource bundle in a            family contains the same items, but the items have been translated for the locale represented
by that resource bundle. For example, both "MyResources" and "MyResources_de" may have a String that's used on a button
for canceling operations.               In "MyResources" the String may contain "Cancel" and in "MyResources_de" it may contain
"Abbrechen".

    If there are different resources for different countries, you can make specializations: for example, "MyResources_de_CH"
contains objects for the German language (de) in Switzerland (CH). If you want to only modify some of the resources in
the specialization, you can do so.

When your program needs a locale-specific object, it loads the ResourceBundle class using the getBundle method:
